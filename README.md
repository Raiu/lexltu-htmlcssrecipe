# My Favorite Recipe

_( Or any recipe at all )_

In this task, you will create a simple website without any direct styling _( except for the browser's default styling )_ about a recipe that you like. It can be your own signature dish or a dish that your mom always used to make for you when you were little.

Before you start building your website, you should do the following:
Create a new repo on your github with a _README.md_ included.
Clone down the repo to your computer _( or fork this )_ and start building your website in that repo, and don't forget to make small commits and push during the process.

When you create the recipe, it is important that the recipe is easy to follow and that the website is built with semantic elements as much as possible.

### Specification

- A header tag that contains a heading in the form of an h-tag as an introductory description of the recipe and maybe why you have chosen this particular recipe.

- At least two images should be included, and both should contain the _alt_ attribute. How you choose to place the images and for what purpose is up to you. But some form of cover image can be good. You can google the images.

- A clear section where you list the ingredients in a "bullet-list". Elements that must be used _( but not limited to )_: section, ul and li.

- A clear section where you list the instructions for the recipe. Elements that must be used _( but not limited to )_: section, ol and li.

- A footer tag where you list some contact information about yourself _( can be made-up information )_. There might be a restaurant or bakery out there that wants to hire you because your recipe looks so delicious!

- CSS! _( Wait with this until after the CSS round )_ Styling is important and should be included, and it should be proper. A tip is to style your recipe page after your recipe, i.e., use a theme that the dish goes in, colors and so on.
